**How to use**

You can run this web app by 2 ways (I recommend you for the 2nd way)

1. Run directly on web

-Fork this repo to your GitHub (https://github.com/homata123/Correct-and-Summarizing-text-app.git) 

-Go to https://share.streamlit.io/ ,sign in and choose "New app"

-Paste the forked repo link into the repo section,then choose "main" branch and gui.py for GUI

-Wait for installing modules and packages,then start using this app

Note: Streamlit web server sometimes encounters errors,you just need to reload page and choose "Reboot" in the option in bottom right of page

2. Clone into local

-Clone this repo to your computer

-Installing necessary modules and packages by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" in terminal

-Install necessary nltk packages as: nltk.download('punkt'), nltk.download('stopwords') 

-Running "streamlit run gui.py" in terminal" (If this is your first time using streamlit,you will need to login by email)

**Note**: If you run this app on Streamlit-make sure your txt file has the same format and structure as file sharapova.txt ( Has just 1 line,if yours has more lines-please turn it into 1 line-txt file),elif you run it directly from terminal (i.e python summarize.py) you don't need to reform your txt as these txt files.
