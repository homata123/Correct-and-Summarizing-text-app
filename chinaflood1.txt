The flooding in July was the worst disaster faced by Henan farmers like Wang in more than 40 years, but it is also an indicator of the extreme weather conditions China could face in the coming decades, as the Earth warms.
As world leaders attend COP26 this week, China is under fire for not setting a more ambitious timeline for phasing out fossil fuels.
"It's very likely that the series of severe floods you saw this past summer in China or Europe were caused by human-caused climate changes."
"As the atmosphere warms, the air can hold more moisture, so if hurricanes happen, they can produce extreme rainfall," said Richard Seager, a climate scientist at Columbia University in the US, know.
"This year, nothing has been gained.
China, the most populous country in the world, with 1.4 billion people, is currently the largest contributor to climate change, responsible for about 28% of the CO2 emissions that warm the Earth.
He had lost his summer crop to floods and by the end of October the land was still too waterlogged to grow winter wheat.
Some corn can still be harvested, but moldy because of water absorption, so it is only sold as animal feed at a very low price.
"Farmers in low-lying areas have lost their crops and have nothing left."
It's all gone," Wang said.
Three months after torrential rains flooded much of central China's Henan province, the entire fertile farmland in this agriculturally inclined locality is still flooded.
Wading in the muddy mud after an unusual flood, Wang Yuetang languished in what used to be a lush peanut and corn farm in Henan province.
On other nearby farms, wilted beans and rotten cabbages were submerged in the sticky water, flies buzzing.
